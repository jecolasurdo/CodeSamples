Unit Testing SQL
================

The included sample was actually generated by the Pathfinder program that I discuss in this sample here: https://github.com/jecolasurdo/CodeSamples/tree/master/Graph%20Traversal

The system that this code was designed to test held a large amount of business logic in a SQL Server database. (It has since been moved to F#, but that's beside the point.)

I include this sample just to demonstrate that it is critical to test our specifications at all levels of the stack, to include the database. With the introduction of utilities like tSQLt, there's really no good excuse to not test the database to ensure that any logic that resides within it is performing as specified.

I find tSQLt to slightly awkward to work with at times, but I give it credit as being a life saving tool nonetheless. It is easy to deploy, easy to use, and I couldn't imagine not having it at my disposal at any time I'm doing database development.
